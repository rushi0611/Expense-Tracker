1. Library Management

Library Management is used to configure studies, vendors, users, and system structure before data processing begins.

It acts as the foundation of the platform.

Without Library Management, data cannot enter the system.

Purpose

Create studies
Define primary and related studies
Configure vendors
Assign standards
Manage access
Maintain hierarchy
Enable inheritance

Study Management

Each study has

Study ID
Study Name
Phase
Therapeutic Area
Primary Flag
Status

Primary Y means main study
Primary N means related study

Example

ONC MASTER 2026 Primary Y
ONC INDIA 2026 Primary N
ONC USA 2026 Primary N

India and USA inherit setup from MASTER.

Vendor Management

Vendors are external data providers.

Examples

Medidata EDC
Quest Lab
Oracle IRT

They are linked to studies.

Output

After setup, study is ready for data flow.

2. GMR Global Metadata Repository

GMR stores all metadata required for processing.

It controls how data flows and transforms.

Stores

DEL
Standards
Mappings
Rules
Functions
Dependencies
Lineage

Example

AGE source to AGE target tracked in lineage.

3. DEL Data Element Library

DEL is the master list of all allowed columns.

Every field must be present in DEL.

Contains

Variable name
Domain
Type
Length
Nullable
Description

Example

DM Domain

STUDYID Text
USUBJID Text
AGE Integer
SEX Text

AE Domain

AE_TERM Text
AE_START_DATE Date

Practical Example

Vendor column GENDER
DEL column SEX
Mapping converts GENDER to SEX.

4. Standards

Standards select required fields from DEL.

They control which variables are used.

Example

Oncology Standard

DM

STUDYID
USUBJID
AGE
SEX

AE

AE_TERM
AE_SEVERITY

Versioning

V1 V2 V3 maintained.

5. Data Ingestion

Data Ingestion loads vendor data into RAW layer.

Sources

CSV
Excel
API
Database

Process

Upload
Validate
Load
Log
Monitor

RAW Layer

Stores original data.

No changes applied.

6. Data Transformation

Transformation converts RAW to standard models.

Flow

RAW to PDL
PDL to SPDM
SPDM to GSDM
GSDM to USDM

Row Level

COPY
FILTER
MERGE
APPEND

Column Level

Direct
Expression
Lookup
Function

Example

SEX M F to 1 2
DATE format conversion
SEQ generation

7. OOTB Functions

OOTB means Out Of The Box functions.

These are pre built functions provided by the system.

They reduce manual coding.

They improve consistency.
